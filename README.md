# Learn-Rails-Tutorial-by-Michael.Hartl

## Intruction
This repository is used to record my learn process by following the book **_Ruby on Rails Tutorial_** worten 
by **Michael Hartl**. You can find this book's online version from [here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). 
The initial plan to finish realize the examples in this book will be committed by chapter. In other words, we see 
a chapter as a iteration. However, we still have quite a bit of flexibility in that. Good luck, let's start.
