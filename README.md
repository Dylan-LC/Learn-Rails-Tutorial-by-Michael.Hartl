## Some basic links you may often use
#### Basic writing and formatting syntax
If you forget some basic writing and formatting syntax in Github, you can the relevant help 
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#links).

#### [Licensing a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/)
We create [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/), to help you understand how to license your code. A software 
license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code, so it's important to make an informed decision.

## Introduction
This repository is used to record my learn process by following the book **_Ruby on Rails Tutorial_** worten 
by **Michael Hartl**. You can find this book's online version from [here](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). 
The initial plan to finish realize the examples in this book will be committed by chapter. In other words, we see 
a chapter as a iteration. However, we still have quite a bit of flexibility in that. Good luck, let's start.

I encourage you to get in the habit of using `less` as your go-to utility for looking at the contents of a file. The 
skills you develop have other applications as well; for example, the man pages use the same interface as less, so by 
learning about `less` youâ€™ll get better at navigating the man pages as well. Here are the most important `less` commands:

| Command | Description |
|:---  |:---  |
| `up & down arrow keys` | Move up or down one line |
| `spacebar` | Move forward one page |
| `^F` | Move forward one page |
| `^B` | Move back one page |
| `G` | Move to end of file |
| `1G` | Move to beginning of file |
| `/<string>` | Search file for string |
| `n` | Move to next search result |
| `N` | Move to previous search result |
| `q` | Quit `less` |

Unix commands above are all commands introduced in *Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous* written by Michael Hartl.
